fw7_loginModal
==============

Working example of a Framework7 Login Modal protected with PHP. Login only once because it will be saved in LocalStorage that you already logged in with the right credentials.
This is not the safest method because you can easily copy the function to call the secured site and paste it into the Developer Console!
